# Workshop Setup



This pre-workshop guide is designed to walk you through the initial setup of git on your computer.  

If you have any issues, please reach out to us at datasci.ph@gmail.com.   

**Introduction**  

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code.  

In order to get setup, we need to install git on your computer, make a GitHub account, and configure git on your computer.  

We will get into the details of how to use git in the workshop, but are requesting that you complete the following steps before the workshop so that we can spend all of the workshop time on using Git rather than on setup!     

## Install R and RStudio if you have not already: 
- https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/  

## Open RStudio and install the following packages:   

- **tidyverse**
- **usethis**
- **gitcreds**
- **broom**

To do this, run the following code in the RStudio console:
`install.packages('tidyverse')` 
Do this for each of the packages. 

*If any of these packages fail to install, please let us know. You may need to update your RStudio but we will try to help you get everything set up with minimal interruption to your other work.*
