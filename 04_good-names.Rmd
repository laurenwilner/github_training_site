# Best practices around folder and file names

When you are working in Terminal/Bash, it is important to have good folder and 
file names to make your life easier. Recall when you name a variable in SAS or 
R, the variable name cannot contain spaces or unusual characters. **It is best 
practice to not use spaces or unusual characters in folder or file names,** even
though spaces are permissible and commonly used by Windows and Mac Users. 

You may wonder what the problem is with spaces, anyway? While 
spaces are human-readable they aren't machine-friendly. When you refer to a 
folder or file using Git in Terminal or Bash, a name without spaces is much 
easier to type (otherwise you have to insert a backslash before the space). 
Spaces also break the auto-complete function that Git users love. This is
frustrating.

Good folder names and files names **use dashes and underscores in place of spaces**.
For example "life-expectancy" is a great folder name for a project estimating 
life expectancy, while "pollution-ptb" is a great folder name for a project 
estimating the causal effect of air pollution on preterm birth. 

**Good analytical file names**

When running a statistical analysis, there is an underlying order across the 
coding files (e.g., starting with importing the data, then data cleaning, and
analysis). Good analytical file names should start with a number (padded by 0) 
to order the files according to the order they are performed in the analysis. This is 
followed by a short (human and machine readable) descriptor of what the file 
does. You can also use underscore "_" to delimit field, and dashes "-" to 
separate words within field. 

For example, here are some of the file names in the "pollution-ptb" folder:

```{r, echo=F, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figures/Variable-names-example.png")
library(emoji)
# emoji(check)
```

These files are: 

* machine readable   
* human readable   
* play well with default ordering

### Bad file naming examples

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figures/Space-in-pathways-pain.png")
```

Here, you can see that there is an R markdown (Rmd) file named "Data Visualization Evaluation Report" that has been modified. The pain arises when I go to `git add` the file. Before each space, I need to include a backslash (which looks ugly). Even worse, the space breaks the auto-complete that happens when I press "tab" to auto-complete the file name. Auto-complete will become your friend when you use Git, and not being able to use it is very sad/infuriating when you have grown to love it.
