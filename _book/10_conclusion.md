# Conclusions

Congratulations - you made it to the end! You have learned how to use git and GitHub both by yourself and with your colleagues - and hopefully we have convinced you that it will help you in both scenarios! 

Remember that git is a tool that can help you track versions, examine changes, and collaborate with others. If you get stuck, never forget that its ok to delete your repository and start over - we have all been there!
