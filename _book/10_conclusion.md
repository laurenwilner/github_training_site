# Conclusions

Congratulations! You made it to the end! You have learned how to use Git and 
GitHub both by yourself and with your colleagues -- and hopefully we have 
convinced you that it will help you in both scenarios.

Git and GitHub can feel intimidating and scary. We hope that through this training
you have gained the confidence you need to forge ahead into your own Git pastures.

You have learned how to track versions, examine changes, and collaborate with 
others. In the coming weeks, if you integrate Git and GitHub into your workflow
you may encounter errors or the dreaded merge conflict. This is normal. Follow 
the "Daily Git Practice" to keep on track, and if you get stuck, never forget 
that its okay to delete your repository, re-clone it, and start over.
