\chapter{Git and GitHub for Public Health}\label{git-and-github-for-public-health}

This is the website for the training \textbf{``Git and GitHub for Public Health''},
first offered in 2024.

\section{Overview}\label{overview}

Keeping track of changes to your statistical code is key to reducing errors and boosting teamwork in your projects. However, many public health professionals, including epidemiologists, haven't been trained on how to manage these changes, which might leave you wondering about the integration with institutional review board (IRB) protocols and privacy rules. On this website, we dive into the basics of Git and GitHub. We're here to show you how these tools can help you confidently and ethically manage your code changes, making your work and research smoother and more secure.

\chapter{Workshop Setup}\label{workshop-setup}

This pre-workshop guide is designed to walk you through the initial setup of Git
on your computer.

If you have any issues, please reach out to us at \href{mailto:c.riddell@berkeley.edu}{\nolinkurl{c.riddell@berkeley.edu}} and
\href{mailto:wilnerl@uw.edu}{\nolinkurl{wilnerl@uw.edu}}.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code.

In order to get setup, you need to install Git on your computer, make a GitHub
account, and then configure Git on your computer.

If you are attending a live workshop, we will cover the details of how to use
Git during the workshop. To ensure the workshop runs smoothly and efficiently,
we request you to complete the following steps before the workshop -- this
enables us to spend all of the workshop time on using Git rather than on setup.
Thank you!

\section{Install R and RStudio}\label{install-r-and-rstudio}

If you don't already have R and RStudio please install them. While the workshop
will also give options using SAS, everyone needs R and RStudio for some pieces
of the workshop -- it should only take a few minutes to download and install
each of these.

\textbf{Link to both downloads:} \url{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}

If you downloads each of these a while ago, we recommend that you update the
versions so everthing runs smoothly.

\section{Open RStudio and install the following packages}\label{open-rstudio-and-install-the-following-packages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{tidyverse}
\item
  \textbf{usethis}
\item
  \textbf{gitcreds}
\item
  \textbf{broom}
\end{itemize}

To do this, run the following code in the RStudio console (lower left-hand side
panel, of the four panel pane):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}tidyverse\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}usethis\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}gitcreds\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}broom\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{If any of these packages fail to install, please let us know.}

If this is your first time using R/RStudio, this video shows how to type the
commands into the console and R looks like when the installs runs smoothly.
\emph{Please view this video in full screen and at high quality to see it properly.}

\section{Create a GitHub account}\label{create-a-github-account}

\url{https://github.com/}

\section{Install Git}\label{install-git}

Installing Git is different depending on whether you are using a Windows or Mac.
Follow the relevant instructions.

\subsection{Windows Instructions}\label{windows-instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Download Git for Windows: \url{https://git-scm.com/download/win}. Once the download
  begins, there are many menu items to click through. As recommended on the
  fantastic website \href{https://happygitwithr.com/install-git}{HappyGitWithR}, accept
  the default selections except for the item ``Adjusting your PATH environment''.
  There, make sure to select ``Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party
  software''. \href{https://happygitwithr.com/install-git}{HappyGitWithR} also notes
  that ``RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to
  be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This
  implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at
  C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise,
  follow this convention.
\end{enumerate}

The following video shows how to download and install Git for Windows. View it
on full screen and in high quality if you want to follow along:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Once you have Git downloads, confirm you have access to Git Bash. To do so,
  it should appear in your Start menu: Start menu \textgreater{} Git \textgreater{} Git Bash.
\item
  RStudio should automatically detect the presence of Git Bash. You can inspect
  and influence this directly via Tools \textgreater{} Global Options \textgreater{} Terminal. Unless you
  have good reason to do otherwise, you want to see ``Git Bash'' in the ``New
  terminals open with \ldots{}'' dropdown menu.
\item
  The next set of tasks are done in RStudio and outlined below in the section
  ``Configure Git using an HTTPS token'' below the Mac instructions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mac Instructions}\label{mac-instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Open up the Terminal application, and type \texttt{git\ -\/-version} to check if Git is
  already installed. If it is, you will see a version number. If it is not, type:
  \texttt{git\ config} and then press return. You will be prompted to install Git and
  follow the prompts!
\end{enumerate}

\section{Configure Git using an HTTPS token}\label{configure-git-using-an-https-token}

In RStudio, load the libraries \texttt{usethis} \& \texttt{gitcreds}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(usethis)}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(gitcreds)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Use the function \texttt{use\_git\_config()} to configure Git using an HTTPS token. To
do so, type the following in the RStudio Console (lower left panel), filling in
a user name, and email. The user name is up to you -- it doesn't need to be your
GitHub user name. \texttt{user.email} is the email address linked to your GitHub
account.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{use\_git\_config}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{user.name =} \StringTok{"Your user name"}\NormalTok{,}
               \AttributeTok{user.email =} \StringTok{"your.email.adress@gmail.com"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next up, you will need to create a personal access token. This is a way to
authenticate yourself with GitHub. You will need to do this in order to push and
pull from your GitHub repository. To do so, run the following in the R console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{usethis}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{create\_github\_token}\NormalTok{()  }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This will bring you to a browser page. Put in a description for your token and
then select an expiration date from the drop down - please select \texttt{No\ expiration}.
Scroll down and click the \texttt{Generate\ token} button. Copy the token that is
generated and paste it somewhere where you will be able to access it.

Go back to R/RStudio and run the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gitcreds}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{gitcreds\_set}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When prompted, paste in the GitHub token you copied from the website. This will
add your credentials to your cache. The following will print out to the RStudio
console:

\begin{verbatim}
? Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  
-> Adding new credentials...
-> Removing credentials from cache...
-> Done.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Download data and code used for the workshop}\label{download-data-and-code-used-for-the-workshop}

Run the following two commands in the RStudio console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"usethis"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{usethis}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{use\_course}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"corinne{-}riddell/existing{-}project"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R will ask you if you want this folder copied onto the Desktop. Select Yes.
\item
  R will display messages showing you that the folder has been downloaded and unzipped.
  Tell R whether to delete the file.
\item
  RStudio will launch.
\item
  If you are attending a live workshop, keep this folder handy -- we will reference
  it then. If you are following along asynchronously we will use this folder in the
  solo workflow section.
\item
  If you would like, feel free to run the code in the folder, but do not otherwise
  edit it at this time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Resources}\label{resources}

You are now set up to use Git and GitHub! If you had any issues, here are
a few links you can look at for help. If you are still having trouble, please
reach out to us before the workshop.

\item
  \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-ControlLinks}{Git Setup Book}
\end{itemize}

If you are attending the live workshop, we will cover the rest of this website
live. See you there!

\chapter{Why Git and GitHub}\label{why-git-and-github}

\section{What is version control, Git, and Github?}\label{what-is-version-control-git-and-github}

\textbf{Version control} is the practice of tracking and managing changes to
(statistical) code and other files.

\textbf{Git} is a version control system. It tracks what is changed in a file,
when and by whom and synchronizes the changes to a central server so that multiple
contributors can manage changes to the same set of files \href{https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510}{(Wilson et al., 2017)}.

\textbf{GitHub} is a hosting service on the web for Git repositories.

\section{The case for version control}\label{the-case-for-version-control}

\textbf{Reduces Errors}

Version control \textbf{eliminates} the need to send code or outputs (graphics,
reports) via email or share folders between collaborators. With a version
control system, everyone has access to the most recent set of files.

\textbf{Facilitates reproducible analyses}

Have you ever tried to reproduce an analysis you did 3 years ago? Have you ever
tried to reproduce someone else's analysis? Have you ever found their links
don't work on your computer? Or that you do not have access to the data?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Because everyone has access to the same files, a project's workflow can be set up
  to ensures that the analyses are reproducible for everyone.
\item
  In R, this can be as simple as hitting the ``knit'' button to run the analyses
  on anyone's computer -- no need to update the file pathways, no need to download
  new versions of the code or data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Eases and supports supervision and collaboration}

With Github, you can easily view changes made to statistical code. So if
you are working together, it is easy to tell what lines of code were changed,
alongside downstream changes to reports or data visualizations as a result of the
change to the analysis.

\textbf{Facilitates rollbacks}

You can use Git to roll back to a previous version of a file at any point. This
is useful if your team decides that a change made to the code was not beneficial
or wants to revert back to a different strategy that was used previously.

\textbf{Supports expeditious sharing of scientific approaches and findings}

Anything posted on GitHub can be shared widely to your organization or with
the public.

\chapter{Git Jargon}\label{git-jargon}

Before diving into using Git and GitHub, we need to become immersed in its
jargon. Fortunately, \href{https://github.com/alicebartlett}{Alice Bartlett}, a
Principal Engineer at the Financial Times, made an excellent set of slides on
Git and GitHub and the associated jargon. She covers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  repository, or ``repo''
\item
  commit
\item
  hash
\item
  checkout
\item
  branch
\item
  merge
\item
  remote
\item
  clone
\item
  push
\item
  pull
\end{itemize}

In the live workshop, we will go through Alice's slides together. If you are
going through this training asynchronously, you can flip through Alice's slides
here:

\chapter{Interacting with Terminal and Bash}\label{interacting-with-terminal-and-bash}

We have two more things to cover before we dive in to Git and Github. First,
we will be using Mac's Terminal and Window's Bash for this training. If you
have never used these applications before, we introduce them below, so you
become familiar with them. Second, we discuss good names for files and folders,
as good names make for good times when you interact with Terminal and Bash.

\section{A Terminal window}\label{a-terminal-window}

We will use Terminal and Bash applications to interact with Git on our laptops.
Below is a Mac Terminal window. It looks very similar to a Windows Bash window.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/Terminal-explainer-1}

In this training, we supply you with Git code for you to type into
your Terminal/Bash windows.

Once you input a command and hit Enter/return on
your keyboard, Terminal/Bash will display output to the screen. Pay attention
to this output as it will indicate if the command was understood by your
computer or if something went wrong. For example, here is the command
\texttt{git\ branch}, followed by the output printed to screen:

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/Terminal-explainer-2}

Here is a cheat sheet of commands we use on this website:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Mac Command & Windows Command & Description \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\texttt{ls} & \texttt{dir} & Lists files and directories \\
\texttt{cd\ \{dir\}} & \texttt{cd\ \{dir\}} & Changes to directory \texttt{\{dir\}} \\
\texttt{cd\ ..} & \texttt{cd\ ..} & Moves up one directory level \\
\texttt{open\ .} & \texttt{start\ .} & Opens the current directory \\
\texttt{pwd} & \texttt{pwd} & Prints the current working directory \\
\end{longtable}

Here is a cheat sheet of commands we don't use but are helpful to know and integrate
into your workflow:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2593}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2963}}

\texttt{history} & \texttt{history} & Shows the command history \\
\texttt{clear} & \texttt{cls} & Clears the terminal screen \\
\end{longtable}

\chapter{Naming folders and files}\label{naming-folders-and-files}

When you are working in Terminal/Bash, it is important to use good folder and
file names to make your life easier.

\textbf{1. Good names for folders: no spaces or special characters}

Recall when you name a variable in SAS or R, the variable name cannot contain spaces or unusual characters. \textbf{It is best practice to not use spaces or unusual characters in folder or file names,} even though spaces are permissible and commonly used by Windows and Mac Users.

You may wonder what the problem is with spaces, anyway? While
spaces are human-readable they aren't machine-friendly. When you refer to a
folder or file using Git in Terminal or Bash, a name without spaces is much
easier to type (otherwise you have to insert a backslash before the space).
Spaces also break the auto-complete function that Git users love. This is
frustrating.

Good folder names and files names \textbf{use dashes and underscores in place of spaces}.
For example ``life-expectancy'' is a great folder name for a project estimating
life expectancy, while ``pollution-ptb'' is a great folder name for a project
estimating the causal effect of air pollution on preterm birth.

\textbf{2. Good names for code files: numbered with underscores and dashes}

When running a statistical analysis, there is an underlying order across the
code files (e.g., starting with importing the data, then data cleaning, and
analysis). Good code file names should start with a number (padded by 0)
to order the files according to the order they are performed in the analysis. This is
followed by a short (human and machine readable) descriptor of what the file
does. You can also use underscore ``\_'' to delimit field, and dashes ``-'' to
separate words within field.

For example, here are some of the file names in the ``pollution-ptb'' folder:

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./figures/Variable-names-example}

These files are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  machine readable\\
\item
  human readable\\
\item
  play well with default ordering
\end{itemize}

Flip through \href{https://jennybryan.org/about/}{Jenny Bryan's} slide set here for a deeper dive into file naming:

\href{https://bph-storage.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/git-for-humans/how-to-name-files.pdf}{Download slides here}

\textbf{3. What happens when there are bad names?}

The issue and frustration of includes spaces in file names really hits home when
you include spaces in the names and trying interacting with GitHub to add the files
and make a commit -- if you like pain and frustration -- you can try this at home!

For example, suppose I made an R markdown file called ``Data Visualization
Evaluation Report.rmd''. In the screenshot below, you can see that this file has
been modified when I used the \texttt{git\ status} command. The issue occurs when I need
to add that file using \texttt{git\ add\ \{file\_name\}}. If I typed \texttt{git\ add\ Data\ Visualization\ Evaluation\ Report.rmd}
there would be an error because Git doesn't know that the name continues after
the space after the word ``Data''! Even worse, the space breaks the auto-complete
functionality that occurs when you press ``tab'' to auto-complete the file name
after typing the first few letters.

To really add the file we need to use the escape character (the backslash ``\textbackslash{}'')
before each space in the name, as shown in the \texttt{git\ add} command highlighted in
yellow. This might not sound like a big deal
if you haven't interacted with Terminal/Bash very much, but I can guarantee you
that the frustration will build to a crescendo over time\ldots{} save yourself this
pain by using dashes and underscores instead of spaces!

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/space-in-filename-pain}

\chapter{Solo Workflow}\label{solo-workflow}

\section{Outline for this section}\label{outline-for-this-section}

We have discussed why Git and GitHub are important, now we will set up a repository and work through an example. During this first section, you will be working in a repository alone. We will:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make new repository on GitHub\\
\item
  Clone the repository to your local machine\\
\item
  Write code in your repository locally\\
\item
  Push the code to your repository\\
\item
  Merge your branch into main
\item
  Repeat the process with more code updates
\item
  Repeat the process with data updates
\end{itemize}

\section{Set up a project that you want to track with Git and GitHub}\label{set-up-a-project-that-you-want-to-track-with-git-and-github}

Let's suppose that you have a project that you want to start tracking using Git
and Github. For this project, you are already working on with some code, data,
and visualizations that have already been saved. We have made this project for you.
It is the one called ``existing-project'' that should be on your Desktop. If it is
not, go back to the Workshop Setup page and run the \texttt{usethis::use\_course("corinne-riddell/existing-project")} code to begin this section.

The \texttt{existing-project} folder contains existing code and things that you might
want to start tracking on GitHub. The next thing to do is make a folder on
GitHub to store this project.

\textbf{Make a new repository on GitHub}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to github.com and log in. Click the green ``New'' button to make a GitHub
  repository. Type ``life-expectancy'' in the repository name.
\item
  Write whatever you want in the description. For example, type ``An analysis of life expectancy in the US''
\item
  Select either to make this a public or private repository.
\item
  Check the box next to \texttt{Add\ a\ README\ file}. This tells Git to create a file that can describe your project. For now, you can write a sentence about this being a practice repository for this workshop.\\
\item
  Choose \texttt{.gitignore} template: \texttt{R}. This tells Git to use defaults that work well for R users.\\
\item
  Keep the license as None. (You would want a license if you are developing code for software, like an R package, but not for every day analysis code).
\item
  Click ``Create repository''. Github will then bring you to the repository's
  main page.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clone the repository to your local machine}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From the main page of your repository and click on the green \texttt{Code} button.\\
\item
  You'll see a URL that starts with \url{https://}. Push the icon with two overlapping
  squares to copy the URL to your clipboard.
\item
  Open Terminal (Mac) or Bash (Windows) program. Navigate to where you want to place
  this repository using the \texttt{cd\ \{folder\_name\}} command. \emph{Note: Whenever we use curly brackets on this website, you do not need to type out curly brackets in your code. For example use \texttt{cd\ Documents/} to navigate to your Documents folder, not \texttt{cd\ \{Documents\}}. This applies wherever you see curly brackets on this website!}
\item
  Then type \texttt{git\ clone\ \{paste\ the\ url\ you\ copied\ here\}} in Terminal/Bash and
  then press the return/enter button. The following will display in Terminal/Bash
  if this was successful:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:repos corinneriddell$ git clone https://github.com/corinne-riddell/life-expectancy.git

Cloning into 'life-expectancy'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done.
\end{verbatim}

You now are ready to begin tracking changes to this folder using Git and GitHub.

\textbf{Get oriented to the new directory}

To get yourself oriented, do the following in the Terminal/Bash window:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Navigate into your repository by typing \texttt{cd\ life-expectancy/}.
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ status}. The results shows you that no changes have been made yet:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ branch}. This shows you that you are currently on the main branch.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$git branch
* main
\end{verbatim}

\section{Make your first branch}\label{make-your-first-branch}

Set yourself up in a new branch off of main. In Terminal/Bash:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ checkout\ -b\ june18-xy}, replacing xy with your initials -- write these
  in lowercase to prevent errors later! (If today is not May 3, replace ``june18''
  with today's date.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git checkout -b june18-cr
Switched to a new branch 'june18-cr'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ branch}, to confirm to yourself that you have indeed switched to
  the new branch.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git branch
  main
* june18-cr
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Make some changes to your tracked folder}

Okay, you are now set up to track changes. Let's do the following:

Copy the code/, data/, and images/ sub-folders from your ``existing-project'' folder into the
``life-expectancy'' folder as well as the .Rproj file.

\textbf{Commit the changes that you made and push them to GitHub}

Go back over to Terminal or Bash. Type \texttt{git\ status}. The output will tell you
what has been changed. It tells us that there are untracked files:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june18-cr
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
    code/
    data/
    images/
    existing-project.Rproj
\end{verbatim}

We want to track the code/, data/, and images/ subfolders we just copied over, as well as the existing-project.Rproj file.

Use \texttt{git\ add} to add the newly-added files to be tracked. Then use \texttt{git\ status} to confirm you have added everything you want to track:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add code/
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add data/
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add images/
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add existing-project.Rproj 
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june18-cr
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    new file:   code/01_Analyze-life-expectancy.R
    new file:   data/Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv
    new file:   images/ca-black-women-LE.png
    new file:   images/placeholder.md
    new file:   existing-project.Rproj

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
\end{verbatim}

Note: Computers create files that we don't want to track. For example, Macs create
.DS\_Store files. Another example is that Windows creates temporary files when a Word
doc or Excel spreadsheet is open. You will see these weird files listed under the
Untracked files list. You don't need to worry about them because we don't want
to track changes to any of those files.

Commit these changes locally: \texttt{git\ commit\ -m\ \textquotesingle{}your\ commit\ message\textquotesingle{}}, replace
`your commit message' with a short message about what you've done (keep the
quotes around the message). For example, your message could be something like
\texttt{git\ commit\ -m\ "added\ first\ set\ of\ files"}.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git commit -m "added first set of files"
[june18-cr 58fcc58] added first set of files
5 files changed, 7253 insertions(+)

create mode 100644 images/ca-black-women-LE.png
create mode 100644 images/placeholder.md
create mode 100644 existing-project.Rproj
\end{verbatim}

Push these changes to GitHub: \texttt{git\ push\ origin\ \{branch-name\}}, replacing
\{branch-name\} with the name of your branch. If you don't remember your branch's
name, type \texttt{git\ branch} to print it to the screen and then the \texttt{git\ push} command.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git push origin june18-cr

\end{verbatim}

You have successfully pushed your changes to GitHub!

\textbf{Merge the changes from your branch into main}

Navigate to GitHub.com to your repository's URL. There should be a pale yellow
banner informing you about the changes you just pushed. Click the button
``Compare \& pull request''. Notice that the title is your commit message from the
previous step. Scroll down. Look at the files that have been added:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The code is all shown in green, indicating that every line of code is new.
\item
  The csv data file has been added but is not rendered because it is large.
\item
  The png file is displayed.
\end{itemize}

To merge your changes into main:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click on the green ``Create pull request'' button. Github will check that it
  is able to merge your branch with main without problems. Note the message ``This
  branch has no conflicts with the base branch''. This means you are good to go!
\item
  Click on the green ``Merge pull request'' button.\\
\item
  Click on the green ``Confirm merge'' button.
\item
  Click the ``Delete branch'' button.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You set up a folder on your laptop so that Git is used to track changes made
  \emph{locally on your laptop}.
\item
  You linked that folder to GitHub.com so that the same changes can be tracked
  externally on GitHub.
\item
  You compared changes you made locally on your branch to the main branch on
  GitHub and pulled your changes into main. This means that the main branch has
  been updated with your changes \emph{on GitHub}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Moving forward: More practice with branching}\label{moving-forward-more-practice-with-branching}

Now suppose a few days have gone by and you are ready to work on your analysis
project. In particular, you want to update some code that will affect some
of the results and ``outputs'', where outputs are results saved in any form. In
this section, we outline the process to follow when you want to implement some
set of tracked changes.

\textbf{Get setup for a new day of work}

The first thing we need to do is make sure we are in a good place with git and
GitHub:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open up Bash or Terminal and navigate to the life-expectancy folder using
  the \texttt{cd} command.
\item
  Check which branch you are currently on using \texttt{git\ branch}. All local branch
  names are displayed. The asterisk is next to the branch we are currently on.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git branch
  main
* june18-cr
\end{verbatim}

Check if you forgot to save anything from last time using \texttt{git\ status}.
Ideally, you have saved all your changes and there is nothing to add/track/commit.
Here is my status:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june18-cr
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
\end{verbatim}

There is one untracked file: .DS\_Store. This is okay since it is an internal
file used by Mac OS that should never be tracked. We just want to ensure
no code files or outputs we intended to track have been forgotten.

You are likely still on your branch from the last day. In that case, navigate
back to main using \texttt{git\ checkout\ main}.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
\end{verbatim}

If you want to double check, type \texttt{git\ branch} to confirm you are on
main.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git branch
* main
  june18-cr
\end{verbatim}

You can also delete the ``june18-XY'' branch since you no longer need to track it
locally:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:github-training corinneriddell$ git branch -d june18-cr
Deleted branch june18-cr (was 58fcc58).
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Pull down the changes from main}

This is your \textbf{local} copy of main. It needs to pull down the changes to
main that you made on GitHub in an earlier step. To do that, type \texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main}.
A graphic will be drawn that summarizes which files have been updated and by
how much.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git pull origin main
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

 create mode 100644 images/ca-black-women-LE.png
 create mode 100644 images/placeholder.md
 create mode 100644 existing-project.Rproj
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Start a new branch}

Like the last day, start a new branch to track today's changes. Let's
pretend it is now May 7. Type \texttt{git\ checkout\ -b\ june21-XY}, where XY is replaced
with your initials. Type \texttt{git\ branch} to confirm you have changed branches.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git checkout -b june21-cr
Switched to a new branch 'june21-cr'
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git branch
  main
* june21-cr
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{You are now ready to make changes!}

Think about what you would like to do in advance. In particular, suppose you
want to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  make a table that summarizes the mean life expectancy by race and
  gender for each state and,
\item
  save the above table as a CSV file into the data folder.
\end{itemize}

To do so, re-launch RStudio by double-clicking the .Rproj file in your file viewer
window. Navigate to the code file 01\_Analyze-life-expectancy.R and insert the
following R code (if working in R) or SAS code (if working in SAS) to make and save this table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# R Code}
\CommentTok{\# Calculate the LE for each state, separately by race and gender:}
\NormalTok{le\_averages }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ le\_data }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(state, race, sex) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean\_LE =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(LE)) }

\CommentTok{\# print the first 10 rows to the screen. By default, R rounds the numeric }
\CommentTok{\# information in the display to make it more compact }
\NormalTok{le\_averages}
\CommentTok{\# alternatively, type View(le\_averages) in the Console to open up a Viewer }
\CommentTok{\# window, or click the table icon beside the le\_averages objects in the }
\CommentTok{\# Environment pane (upper right hand panel of RStudio).}

\CommentTok{\#save this table as a CSV file in the data sub{-}folder}
\FunctionTok{write\_csv}\NormalTok{(le\_averages, }\StringTok{"./data/le\_averages.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/*SAS Code*/

/*Calculate the LE for each state, separately by race and gender:*/
proc sort data=le_data; by state race sex; run;
proc means data=le_data; by state race sex; var le; output out=le_averages mean=mean_le ; run;

/*Print the first 10 rows to the screen*/
proc print data=le_averages (obs=10); run;
/*Or you could just open the dataset to browse it.*/

/*Export this file to a .csv file 
(if you use the following code, don't forget to replace YourFilePathHere with the appropriate file path!)*/
PROC EXPORT DATA= WORK.LE_AVERAGES 
            OUTFILE= "YourFilePathHere\data\le_averages.csv" 
            DBMS=CSV REPLACE;
     PUTNAMES=YES;
RUN;
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Track your changes using Git}

Re-run your previous R code (highlight all the previous code and hit
command + Return {[}Mac{]} or control + Enter {[}Windows{]}). Then run the newly-added
code line by line to see what it is doing. \textbf{Don't forget to save the updated
.R file by pushing the save icon!} After all that, track the changes using Git.
Go to the Bash/Terminal window. Type \texttt{git\ status}.
Which files have been modified? Which files are new and untracked?

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june21-cr
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   code/01_Analyze-life-expectancy.R

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
    data/le_averages.csv
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Add new and modified files}

Use \texttt{git\ add} to add the specific files that have been modified or created.
Add them one by one. Use \texttt{git\ status} again to check that all the changed files
are being tracked. When you are satisfied, commit these changes locally.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add code/01_Analyze-life-expectancy.R 
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add data/le_averages.csv 
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june21-cr
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   code/01_Analyze-life-expectancy.R
    new file:   data/le_averages.csv

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Commit the changes locally}

Helpful hint: Terminal/Bash plays well with autocomplete. For example, if you
are typing the pathway for the .R file as ``code/\ldots{}'' you can push the tab button
as you are typing the name and it will autocomplete. This makes selecting the
specific files to commit much easier.

\texttt{git\ commit\ -m\ \textquotesingle{}\{your\ message\}\textquotesingle{}}
Replace `your message' with a short message describing the changes. Remember to keep the quotes around the message!

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git commit -m 'calc LE averages' 
[june21-cr a7435b8] calc LE averages
 2 files changed, 177 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 data/le_averages.csv
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Push the changes up to GitHub}

You are now ready to push these changes up to GitHub onto GitHub's version
of your local branch. First, remind yourself of your branch's name using
\texttt{git\ branch}. Then push: \texttt{git\ push\ origin\ \{YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\}}, replacing
\{YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\} with the name of your branch.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git branch

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Create a pull request}

Navigate to GitHub.com and go through the steps described previously to
create a pull request to pull these changes into main.

\section{Another practice: Changes after receiving an updated dataset}\label{another-practice-changes-after-receiving-an-updated-dataset}

Another week goes by. It is now May 14. You received an email that there was an
error in the data file that you used to conduct the analysis. A new data file
was securely transferred to you by the data holder. You need to rerun the analysis
using the new dataset. The new data file is the one called ``LEbsyrx.csv'' in the
data folder.

\textbf{Get ready for the day}

Set yourself up to work with Git and GitHub for the day:

\texttt{git\ branch}: see which branch you are on:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git branch
  main
* june21-cr
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{git\ status}: confirm you committed everything you wanted to commit:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june21-cr
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{git\ checkout\ main}: switch to the main branch
\item
  \texttt{git\ branch\ -d\ june21-cr}: delete the old branch (change ``cr'' to your initials)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main}: pull GitHub's copy of the main branch to update your
local version. Examine the figure made by Git about the changes:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git pull origin main
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), done.

 2 files changed, 177 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 data/le_averages.csv
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Checkout a new branch}

\texttt{git\ checkout\ -b\ june25-xy}, replacing xy with your initials.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git checkout -b june25-cr
Switched to a new branch 'june25-cr'
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Update the dataset}

Update the CSV file ``Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv'' with the new dataset.
First, decide if you want to archive this older version of the dataset for any reason.
If you do, then decide where you would store the archived version and move it there.
The archived version could stay on GitHub or be moved off of GitHub -- this is
up to you and your file organization system. Then, copy the dataset called
``Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv'' from the existing-project/future-data
subfolder and paste it into the life-expectancy/data subfolder.

Re-run all your code that uses this file. First open the .Rproj file to launch RStudio. Then, you can highlight all the code and hit the ``Run'' button.

\textbf{Track the changes using Git}

Use \texttt{git\ status}, \texttt{git\ add...}, and \texttt{git\ commit...} to track these changes
locally. Use \texttt{git\ push} to push these changes to GitHub.

Using \texttt{git\ status}, I can see that the data files have all been modified, as has
the image file of the plot. There is a new untracked folder called data/archive/
where I moved the archived dataset.

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   data/le_averages.csv
    modified:   images/ca-black-women-LE.png

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
    data/.DS_Store
    data/archive/
\end{verbatim}

I use \texttt{git\ add} to specify all the new things I want to track:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add data/Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv 
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add data/le_averages.csv 
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add images/ca-black-women-LE.png 
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git add data/archive/
\end{verbatim}

I then use \texttt{git\ status} to confirm everything is being tracked:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git status
On branch june25-cr
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   data/Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv
    new file:   data/archive/Life-expectancy-by-state-long_old.csv
    modified:   data/le_averages.csv
    modified:   images/ca-black-women-LE.png

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
    data/.DS_Store
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Commit the changes locally}

Then I commit my changes:

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$ git commit -m 'data update and downstream changes'
[june25-cr c4b02db] data update and downstream changes
 4 files changed, 7570 insertions(+), 369 deletions(-)

 rewrite images/ca-black-women-LE.png (98%)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Push the changes to GitHub}

Finally I push these changes to GitHub:

\begin{verbatim}
git push origin june25-cr
Enumerating objects: 14, done.
Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Submit a pull request}

Go through the process to start a pull request. On the pull request page,
scroll down to see the ``diffs'' in the data and image. Pay close attention to
the files that were changed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use the ``2-up'' ``swiper'' and ``onion skin'' tools to see the changes to the saved figure.
  How did the data changed? Which tool do you prefer?
\item
  can you see which rows of data were affected by the change?
\item
  can you tell from the data or images how the change affected the analytic findings?
\item
  anything else you noticed?
\end{itemize}

After looking at the changes, go through the process to merge the pull request
into main.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}

Congratulations, you have successfully worked in Git and GitHub solo! What a
journey. You now know how to transition your existing work to being tracked
using Git and GitHub, and how to track new changes using \texttt{git\ add}, \texttt{git\ commit},
and push them to your GitHub using \texttt{git\ push\ origin\ \{branch\}}. You also learned
how to pull these changes back into main using \texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main}, and how to
create, switch, and delete branches.

There are a lot of steps to remember, but if you do this for a week it will
become easier. To help you get started, feel free to use the ``Daily Git Practice''
guide (linked on the left), which provides a handy guide covering all the
commands covered in this section.

\chapter{Group Workflow}\label{group-workflow}

\section{Outline for this section}\label{outline-for-this-section-1}

In the previous section, you got up and running with working alone in Git and
GitHub. During this section, we're going to learn how to collaborate with others
using Git and GitHub. We will:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Set up a shared repository
\item
  Make a first commit
\item
  Cover three routes for collaboration:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Independent Work
  \item
    Code Review
  \item
    Working on the same files

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Practice resolving a merge conflict
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}\label{setup}

To get the most out of this section of the training, you need a training buddy.
One of you will be the \emph{lead researcher}, and the other will be the \emph{colleague}.
The lead researcher will create the repository, and the colleague will contribute to it.

\textbf{Lead Researcher: Create a new repository on GitHub}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to GitHub, click on the ``+'' icon in the top-right corner, and select \texttt{New\ repository}.
\item
  Follow the same instructions as we did in the solo workflow to create a new
  repository (add a README, choose a license, etc.).
\item
  Add your colleague as a collaborator by going to
  \texttt{Settings} \textgreater{} \texttt{Collaborators} \textgreater{} \texttt{Add\ people}. Ask your colleague for their
  GitHub username and add them to this repository.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Colleague: Join the repository}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Check your email for an invitation to collaborate on the repository.
\item
  Accept the invitation by clicking on the link in the email.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Both: Clone the repository}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to the main page of the repository clicking on the green \texttt{Code} button and
  copying the URL. Then, in Bash/Terminal navigate to the location where you will
  clone your repository and run the following command:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
git clone {repository URL}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Get oriented to the new directory}\label{get-oriented-to-the-new-directory}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Navigate into your repository by typing \texttt{cd\ \{repo-name\}}
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ status}. The results shows you that no changes have been made yet:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:collabo-repo corinneriddell$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ branch}. This shows you that you are currently on the main branch.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Biostat-MBP13-20:life-expectancy corinneriddell$git branch
* main
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Both:} Create a new branch. Now that we know that our repository is cloned,
  up to date, and on main, we can make a new branch to work on:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
git checkout -b {new-branch-name}
git branch
\end{verbatim}

Typing \texttt{git\ branch} will show you that you are now on the new branch, though
only the first line was \emph{necessary} to create this branch.

\section{Collaborative Routes}\label{collaborative-routes}

In general, there are three ways to work collaboratively on a project:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Collaborative route \#1 (Independent work)}: You each work on separate files and merge your own changes. It is similar to creating several separate documents and
  storing them in a shared folder for you both to view.\\
\item
  \textbf{Collaborative route \#2 (Code review)}: Submit pull requests for code reviews without direct edits. It is similar to having a shared document where you can leave comments for each other - like when you leave comments on a MS Word document for your colleague.\\
\item
  \textbf{Collaborative route \#3 (Working on the same files)}: You both work on the same file and merge in your changes. Sometimes this leads to merge conflicts so additional care is needed. It is similar to having a shared document where you
  can make changes directly to your colleague's work -- think about working collaboratively on a document in the cloud where both individuals can edit the
  document at the same time, but weird things might happen if you are working on the same sentence at the same time.
\end{enumerate}

We will cover each collaborative route below.

\subsection{Collaborative Route \#1: Independent work}\label{collaborative-route-1-independent-work}

You each work on separate files and merge your own changes. To start, the
repository will have two files, one that each of you made. In general, you could
maintain several files, each of your working on the specific files that make
sense but never editing each other's files.

Let's practice this workflow now:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Lead researcher:} Save a code file that you brought to this workshop in the shared repository.
\item
  \textbf{Colleague:} Save a code file that you brought to this workshop in the shared repository. If
  your file has the same name as the lead researcher's file, rename it now.
\item
  \textbf{Both:} Add, commit, and push your respective files to GitHub:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
git add {file-name}
git commit -m "Initial commit with {file-name}"
git push origin {new-branch-name}
\end{verbatim}

If the output from the push command looks successful, you are now ready to create
a pull request following the same process we used in the solo workflow section.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Both:} Navigate to GitHub.com to your repository's URL. There should be a pale yellow
  banner informing you about the changes you just pushed. Click the button
  ``Compare \& pull request''. Notice that the title is your commit message from the
  previous step. Scroll down. Look at the files that have been added.
\item
  The code is all shown in green, indicating that every line of code is new.
\item
  Merge the changes from your branch into main
\item
  Click on the green ``Create pull request'' button. Github will check that it
  is able to merge your branch with main without problems. Note the message ``This
  branch has no conflicts with the base branch''. This means you are good to go!
\item
  Click on the green ``Merge pull request'' button.\\
\item
  Click on the green ``Confirm merge'' button.
\item
  Click the ``Delete branch'' button.
\end{itemize}

Both of your files have been merged into the main branch. Let's take a look. Go
into the main \texttt{Code} page and take a look at the code on \texttt{main} (which should be
the only existing branch in your repository). You should see the files that
\emph{both} of you created in the previous steps.

\textbf{Recap}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You have now successfully completed the first collaborative route. You each
  created a file, committed it, and merged it into the main branch. You worked on
  different files and had no merge conflicts or interaction, but now have access
  to each other's work!
\item
  In this workflow, you could continue working independently on your file in
  the shared repo and add other files as you go along.
\item
  ❗ Take care: Now that you are working together, be sure
  to use \texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main} to frequently grab any changes your colleague made to the
  repository. You should be doing this already, but it is even more important
  when you are working together so you can stay up to date on whatever changes
  have been made to the repository.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaborative Route \#2: Code Review}\label{collaborative-route-2-code-review}

In Collaborative Route \#2, the lead researcher will make a new file, make
changes to that file and push these to GitHub. The colleague will then review
these changes by submitting comments on the pull request.

Let's practice this workflow now:

\textbf{Everyone:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Checkout main, and pull down the changes
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git status
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Lead researcher steps:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a new branch. Pretend it is the next day and include this date in the
  branch name alongside your initials:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
git checkout -b {new-branch-name}
git branch
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make and \textbf{save a change} to the file you added in the previous step.
  You can add in a comment or a new line of code - something small is good. \textbf{Save
  your file.}
\item
  Add, commit, and push your changes to your branch on GitHub:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
git status
git add {file-name}
git commit -m "{your description of what you changed}"
git push origin {your-branch-name}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to your GitHub repository page. You should see a notification about your
  recent push. Click on ``Compare \& pull request'' next to your branch.
\item
  ❗ \textbf{NEW STEP ALERT}: Fill in the details of the pull
  request, explaining what you've added or changed and why.
\item
  ❗ \textbf{NEW STEP ALERT}: Add your colleague as a
  reviewer. We will not immediately merge this in this time!
\item
  Submit the pull request.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Colleague steps:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Once the pull request is submitted, the colleague should receive an email telling them
  that the lead researcher requested their review on PR \#\{X\}.
\item
  Click \texttt{View\ it\ on\ GitHub} and it will bring you to GitHub and there will be a
  yellow box at the top.
\item
  Click on \texttt{Add\ your\ review} in the yellow box. Then click \texttt{Review\ changes} in green in the right corner.
\item
  Leave comments on the pull request by clicking the plus signs next to chunks
  of code. You can leave multiple comments. Your feedback can include suggestions,
  questions, or general feedback about the code. Focus on clarity, efficiency, and
  any potential errors you might notice.
\item
  When you're finished commenting, click \texttt{Finish\ your\ review} in green in the top right.
\item
  Submit your comments. You have three review options:
\end{itemize}

Let's take a moment to talk briefly about each of these review options.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.1000}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.9000}}@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
✅ \textbf{Comment} & This submits feedback without explicitly approving the pull request. This will send the lead researcher an email with your comments on their code. The lead researcher can click \texttt{View\ it\ on\ GitHub} to see your comments. They can reply and/or merge the pull request into main at this point. This can be used either as an FYI or to start a conversation about the code - e.g.~maybe a certain function is new to you so you want to ask about why they chose to use that. You may want to use this if you have a workflow where you always want the person who wrote the code to do the merging. \\
✅ \textbf{Approve} & This submits feedback and approves the PR for merging into main. This will send the lead researcher an email with your comments that will also indicate that the pull request is approved. This option can be used as an FYI, e.g., telling them about an alternate function that they \emph{could} use but do not have to. Either person can merge the pull request into main. You can establish norms around how these work with your colleagues - there is no right answer! \\
✅ \textbf{Request Changes} & Submit feedback that the other person needs to address before they can merge into main. This will send the lead researcher an email with your comments that will also indicate that the PR needs changes. This option can be used if you see something that needs to change before the pull request can be merged - e.g.~a function that is not working as intended. The lead researcher will need to address your comments before they can merge the pull request into main. \emph{Technically, the PR could be merged in without the changes, but this is not good practice.} \\
& \\
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Lead Researcher:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Review the comments made by your colleague. Make any necessary changes to your code based on the feedback.
\item
  Add, commit, and push these changes to the same branch. This will automatically update the pull request.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Colleague:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will receive an email saying that the lead researcher pushed one commit. At this point, the colleague can click \texttt{View\ it\ on\ GitHub} and verify that the changes are sufficient.
\item
  Review the changes made by the lead researcher in response to your comments. If you're satisfied with the updates, approve the pull request.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lead Researcher:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Once the pull request is approved, merge your changes into the main branch.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recap}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You have successfully completed the second collaborative route. You used Git to
  review/check/comment on your colleague's work without emailing
  or copying/pasting code back and forth. The lead researcher made changes to
  their code based on your feedback, and you both worked together to finalize the
  pull request.
\item
  Similar to the previous workflow, collaborators can work independently, but
  request review of each other's work.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaborative Route \#3: Working on the same files}\label{collaborative-route-3-working-on-the-same-files}

In this scenario, imagine that the lead researcher has already created and
committed an analysis file. The colleague then wants to make direct changes to
that file or extend the analysis. This is a commonly used workflow,
and works well if both people are working sequentially and pulling from main
often to pull down any changes made to the repo as their collaborators work.

This diagram shows how both Lauren and Corinne can work on the same file,
sequentially over time, each pulling from main, making changes, and merging their
changes back into main before the other person works:

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/no-conflict}

However, this collaborative route leaves room for the dreaded merge conflict.

Merge conflicts can be a source of stress for many GitHub users. While they can
be scary, you are in good company when you have your first merge conflict --
everyone has a merge conflict eventually.

What is a merge conflict, you might ask, and how does it happen? Well, a merge
conflict can happen if you and a colleague both pull from main at the same
time and proceed to edit the same location on the same file. If colleague \#1
merges their changes into main, then when colleague \#2
goes to merge their changes into main, GitHub doesn't know what changes to keep.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/conflict}

If this seems a little convoluted, it is your lucky day. We will set the stage
for a merge conflict and practice resolving it with our buddy.

\textbf{Creating a merge conflict}

\textbf{Everyone}:
- Checkout and pull any changes: \texttt{git\ checkout\ main} and \texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main} to make sure you are up to date.
- Make and checkout a new branch: \texttt{git\ checkout\ -b\ \{new-branch-name\}}. Each of
you should call their branch something different from the other researcher.
- Together, choose one file and one line location on the file that you will each
edit separately on your laptops.
- Each of you should make the edits you agreed upon to the single line location that you decided you would edit. You should both make \emph{different} changes. \textbf{Save your code file.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Lead researcher only:} add, commit, and push your changes to your branch.
  Then, create a pull request and merge your changes into main.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Colleague:} Your turn. Add, commit, and push your changes to your branch.
  Then, create a pull request. 😱 Merge conflict! You will not
  be able to merge into main.
\end{itemize}

Deep breaths. Let's walk through how to resolve the merge conflict.

The colleague with the conflict will see the following. Colleague, follow these steps!
Lead researcher, watch your colleague's screen to follow along:

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/merge-conflict-1}

Click on \texttt{View\ Pull\ Request} to begin resolving the merge conflict. When you click on \texttt{View\ Pull\ Request}, you will see the following:

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/merge-conflict-2}

Click on \texttt{Resolve\ conflicts} to begin resolving the merge conflict. When you click on \texttt{Resolve\ conflicts}, you will see the following:

\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{./figures/Example-merge-conflict-github}

Together, look at the code in the file. Decide which edits you will keep. For
this exercise, it is arbitrary which edits you keep. However, in practice you
will make this decision in an informed way.

When you choose what to keep, delete the \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} and \texttt{===} and \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}} lines, as
well as the lines from the person whose code you are not keeping. When you are
finished, click \texttt{Mark\ as\ resolved} in the top right corner. Now that you have
clicked \texttt{Mark\ as\ resolved}, you will see a green check mark next to the file
name, and it will say \texttt{Resolved} in the top right corner. There will also be a
green button in the top right corner that says \texttt{Commit\ merge}. Click on this
button. This brings you back to the page you are familiar with, where you can
merge into main. Click \texttt{Merge\ pull\ request} and then \texttt{Confirm\ merge}. You can
delete the branch as you usually do.

\textbf{Everyone}:
You can both checkout main and pull down the changes. You will now see that the file with the merge conflict has been cleaned up and you will see only the code that you accepted above!

\textbf{Recap}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You have just resolved your first merge conflict!
\item
  In this route you worked together on the same files. If you had edited different
  sections of the file, you could successfully merge both of your changes into main.
  In this instance, both of you edited the same line of code, which created a
  merge conflict. You resolve the merge conflict.
\item
  To minimize the change of merge conflicts, make sure you do \texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main} before you
  start your day's work to pull down the most recent version of the repo. If you do
  get a conflict, you know how to resolve it. You will need to make a decision about
  which version of the code to keep. It should be clear based on what you hope to
  accomplish in the analysis.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{What to track on Git and Github?}\label{what-to-track-on-git-and-github}

\section{Approach 1 : Track statistical code only}\label{approach-1-track-statistical-code-only}

Some people use Git and Github to track changes to their statistical code only.
Here, they are only tracking their code files in R (.R or .Rmd), or
SAS (.SAS), or the corresponding files for whichever language they use.

They add all other types of files to the .gitignore file so that Git
won't track them or accidentally push them to GitHub. Under this approach,
untracked files include: data files, word documents, PDFs, image files, etc --
anything else you are storing looking in the folder tracked by git that you do
not want pushed to GitHub.

This approach most closely corresponds to how GitHub is used by software
developers/other code writers, and is used by researchers and research
teams depending on their objectives.

\section{Approach 2: Track statistical code, some data files, images, and other documents}\label{approach-2-track-statistical-code-some-data-files-images-and-other-documents}

Some people use Git and Github to track a variety of files including their code,
\emph{some} of their data files, as well as images and other documents. This approach
is often used by advocates of reproducible research, and to give outsiders a
fuller picture of an entire research project.

Sometimes, you can post your data, if it is unrestricted and not too large. In
this case, you can set up your GitHub so that all of your data visualizations
as well as a completed report can be reproduced by someone who is not affliated
with your project.

In many research or public health settings, you are not able to share the data.
In this case, you can still share other aspects of your project with the wider
community.

\subsection{Data files do's and dont's}\label{data-files-dos-and-donts}

❌ \textbf{Don't track restricted data!}

Restricted data cannot be posted on GitHub. A best practice is to store it
securely outside of your tracked folder to ensure there is no chance of it being
posted.

❌ \textbf{Don't track large datasets!}

Git will warn you if your file exceeds 50 MB and
block you from tracking files 100 MB or larger. To ensure these files aren't tracked, you can store them elsewhere (outside of
the tracked Git folder), or store them in the tracked folder while also listing them or their file type to your .gitignore file.

❌ \textbf{WARNING FOR MAC USERS: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU TRACK .DS\_STORE files!}

If you are a Mac user, you may not even know what a .DS\_STORE file is. These are
invisible files that are created whenever you view a folder using Finder. You
will see them when you write \texttt{git\ status}. You do not want to track these files
as it can allow people to hack your computer!! As a best practice, add these
to your .gitignore file to ensure that they are never tracked by you or anyone
else contributing to your project.

🤔 \textbf{Consider tracking intermediate data products}

Generally, it also doesn't often make sense to track a large ``raw'' data file -- it is too big and not useful to track any changes to this file. It may be helpful to track ``intermediate data products'', if these files are not restricted. Intermediate data products might include aggregated datasets that are either reported directly or used in analysis. For example, you may have access to a restricted dataset, but the data may become non-restricted if you aggregate at the level of the census tract. The benefit of tracking this smaller dataset is that if the raw data is updated, you can easily see how those updates affect these intermediate data products if you track them. In this case you need to ensure you are not reporting any private/restricted data (eg no cell counts below 10 is a restricted often imposed on aggregated tables, or not reporting any identifying features such as protected health information or anything else that would allow anyone with access to identify
individuals.

✅ \textbf{Do track plain text data files (e.g., csv and txt files) }

These are best for tracking because they render nicely on GitHub, so you can
easily view the differences to these files when you submit a pull request. You
could also track things like Excel files but you can't easily view them on
GitHub, so some of the benefits of using GitHub do not apply to these files.

\subsection{Images dos and dont's}\label{images-dos-and-donts}

You can also track image files (e.g., png, jpeg), such as plots/other figures
you create for a report. The benefit of tracking figures are the use of the
\href{https://github.blog/2011-03-21-behold-image-view-modes/}{image comparison tools}
in GitHub to see an image pre/post a change in the
analysis. This can be super helpful when you have modified something in the
analysis after having already written up some results. If you track the image,
you can easily see how it changed (it being the point estimates and confidence
intervals, of the slope of the regression line, or the shading of a colored map).
This has the direct pay-off of making it much easier to revise the written
result.

\textbf{2-up comparison:}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/2-up-example}

\textbf{Swipe comparison:}

\textbf{Onion skin comparison:}

❌ \textbf{Dont' track very large image files}

One thing to be careful about is not uploading very large images like the
ones that are generated by some GIS analyses (large maps). If you aren't sure if
you should track your image file, take a look at the file size. (I had a look at
all of my repositories for epidemiologic analyses -- most images were \textless{} 1000 kb.
Some were between 1 MB and 4 MB -- these were some maps and some images saved at
higher resolutions.)

\subsection{Documents}\label{documents}

You can also track reports and manuscripts using GitHub. If these reports are
written in a plain text language (e.g., R markdown, LaTeX) then they will render
nicely on GitHub and, and permit you to see the ``diffs'' made to the document
during a pull request. Tracking pdfs is permissible but you can't easily see the
``diffs'' when they are updated. However, pdfs are easily viewable on GitHub.
Tracking docx files is also permissible, but you can't easily see the ``diffs''
and they are not easily viewable on GitHub (since they require MS Word to render
them).

✅ \textbf{Do track plain text reports like R markdown files}\\
🤔 \textbf{Consider tracking PDFs (easily viewable on GitHub)}\\
❌ \textbf{Don't track Word documents (cannot view)}

\section{Things you definitely do not want to track}\label{things-you-definitely-do-not-want-to-track}

❌ \textbf{Anything that is private or restricted or that you would never want to
inadvertently share.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This includes passwords, or API keys that you might use to extract data.
\item
  For example, I have an API key to access Census data. I do not include this
  API key in my GitHub repository. There are methods for writing the code to still
  access the key on my personal computer without writing it out explicitly in the
  code.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Daily Git Practice}\label{daily-git-practice}

Use these instructions each day you are working in your repository for good practice!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open Terminal (Mac) or Bash (Windows). Navigate to your repository using \texttt{cd}.
\item
  When you get to your directory, type \texttt{git\ branch} to remind yourself
  which branch you are on as you main be on a branch from the previous work day.
  Type \texttt{git\ status} to ensure you committed and pushed everything the last time
  you used Git and GitHub. If there is nothing to commit, go to the next step.
  If there are files with changes to be committed, you will need to figure out if
  you want to commit those changes or if you want to discard them. If you want to
  discard them, type \texttt{git\ restore\ \{file-name\}} to discard changes to that file. Do
  this for all files until you have a clean directory if you are sure you don't
  want to track those changes. If you want to commit them, follow steps 10 through 19
  before proceeding to Step 2.
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ checkout\ main}.
\item
  Type \texttt{git\ pull\ origin\ main}. This will pull the changes you made
  the day before and get you ready to start on a clean branch today.
\item
  Delete the previous day's branch. Type \texttt{git\ branch\ -d\ \{branch-name\}}.
  Remember to replace \texttt{\{branch-name\}} with your previous day's branch
  name. If you don't remember what it was named, type \texttt{git\ branch} to display a
  list of all the branches you have.
\item
  Create and checkout a new branch by typing \texttt{git\ checkout\ -b\ \{new-branch-name\}}.
  Replace the \texttt{\{new-branch-name\}} with a new branch name. This may be something
  like \texttt{\{your-initials\_date\}}.
\item
  Do your work. Try to perform ``your work'' as a discrete task that you can summarize
  with one commit message. If you have more to do, then make multiple commits in
  one day.
\item
  Once you are done, go back to Terminal/Bash (where you should already be in
  your repository directory) type \texttt{git\ status} to see which files have been modified
  and should be staged for a commit. You may have some untracked files that you
  created and also want to track.
\item
  Add your newly added and modified files to the staging area by typing
  \texttt{git\ add\ \{file-names\}}. You can add all the files that you edited/created.
\item
  Commit your changes by typing \texttt{git\ commit\ -m\ "\{commit-message\}"}. Replace
  \texttt{\{commit-message\}} with your commit message (don't forget to keep the quotes
  around the message)!
\item
  Remind yourself of your branch's name by typing \texttt{git\ branch}. Then push your
  changes to the remote repository by typing \texttt{git\ push\ origin\ \{new-branch-name\}}.
  Replace \texttt{\{new-branch-name\}} with your new branch name.
\item
  In a browser, go to your repository on GitHub.
\item
  If this is the first time you committed to this branch, there should be a
  yellow banner on your GitHub home page with a ``pull request'' button. If not, you
  can navigate to the Code tab, change to your branch, and you will see the code
  that you just worked on! It is now up on GitHub!
\item
  Click on the \texttt{Pull\ requests} tab.
\item
  Click on the green \texttt{New\ pull\ request} button.
\item
  Click on the green \texttt{Create\ pull\ request} button.
\item
  Click on the green \texttt{Merge\ pull\ request} button.
\item
  Click on the green \texttt{Confirm\ merge} button.
\item
  Delete your branch on GitHub when prompted.
\item
  You are now ready to do this all over the next day!
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Assorted Git processes and tips}\label{assorted-git-processes-and-tips}

This page introduces a few Git and GitHub processes that didn't nicely fold into the other chapters, but which we think make be useful to you

\section{Forking}\label{forking}

Remember when we went through \textbf{branching}? \textbf{Branching} is the process of creating a new branch where you can make changes to code separately from the main branch. When you finish your changes, you merge your branch into main and delete the branch. \textbf{Branching} is a critical tool for working with Git repositories and ensuring that the main branch remains functional and clean. Even if you do not merge your branch back in, the owner of the repository can see your branch on GitHub, take a look at what you have done, and foster collaboration with the members of the repository.

\textbf{Branching}:

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/branching}

\textbf{Forking} is a similar process, but it is used when you want to build off of someone else's repository. When you \textbf{fork} a repository, you create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. You can then make changes to the repository in your account without affecting the original repository. The owner of the original repository will not be a member of your forked repository. The forked repository is essentially your repository now. You can think about this as similar to receiving a Google folder, downloading its contents, and saving it to your computer. The original Google folder is still there, the people with ownership and access to the original Google folder are unaffected, but now you have a completely separate folder on your computer that is not a collaboration with the original Google folder team in any way.

Why fork? Forking is a great way to contribute to open-source projects or to change a repository that you don't have ``write'' access to. Forking also circumvents reinventing the wheel -- perhaps your colleagues developed a suite of functions for cleaning malaria data, and you need similar functions for your dengue project. You can fork their repository, make changes to tailor these functions to dengue, and use their functions in your project.

\textbf{Forking}:

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/forking}

\textbf{Forking} is core to the premise of Git and the effort to move towards open-source software development. It allows for collaboration within workplaces, disciplines, and around the world for the sharing of code and ideas.

\section{Ignoring files}\label{ignoring-files}

When you are working on a project, you will often have files that you do not
want to track with Git. Such files, such as restricted datasets and large
datasets, were discussed in the ``What to track on Git and GitHub'' chapter.

Decisions around data storage are a team decision and may require input from
your information technology department or institutional review board. If
permitted according to the data's level of security, some teams will store some
data on Git in a private repository, while other teams will use shared drives for
data storage and Git/GitHub for code sharing, and, finally, other teams will store
the data in their Git repository but not push them to GitHub.

About that last one -- yes, you can store files in your GitHub folder but never
choose to track them. To do this, use a \texttt{.gitignore} file to tell Git to ignore
these files.

A \texttt{.gitignore} file is a list of files that Git is instructed not to track.
Whenever you \texttt{add} files in your repository, for example, Git will ignore the
files listed in your \texttt{.gitignore} file.

\textbf{Here's an example of the contents of a .gitignore file:}

\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{./figures/gitignore}

This .gitignore file instructs Git to ignore any files that end with \texttt{.sql} or \texttt{.sqlite}, as
well as any files in the \texttt{build} subfolder. Git ignore files are handy if
you have a workflow where you store most of a project's files within the Git
repository, since it allows you to specify which files to ignore. Git ignore
files are less useful if you have a workflow
where you want everything in your repository to be pushed to GitHub.

\section{Rolling back changes}\label{rolling-back-changes}

Another advantages of Git and GitHub is the ability to roll back changes.
Perhaps you committed a few iterations of code and realized that
the code you wrote three commits ago was, in hindsight, the best version. No worries -- you can roll
back to that commit and start from there. This is a great way to experiment with
code and try new things without worrying about losing your work. To do this, you
can either use \texttt{git\ checkout} to check out a previous commit, or you can use
\texttt{git\ revert} to revert a commit. This process is a bit complicated, but there is
a great walk through \href{https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/05-history.html}{here}.

\section{And if all else fails\ldots{}}\label{and-if-all-else-fails}

Remember that Git is a tool that can help you track versions, examine changes,
and collaborate with others. If you get stuck, never forget that its okay to
delete your repository and start over - both of these website's co-author have
done this (repeatedly\ldots{} even while creating this website).

There are many comics and memes about Git and the struggles that come with it-- include the acceptability of burning down your repository and starting over!

Remember that you are not alone in your struggles and that there are many resources available to help you. It is ALWAYS okay to just save your code elsewhere for a moment and start over.
