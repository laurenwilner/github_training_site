<p>In the previous section, you got up and running with working alone in Git and
GitHub. During this section, we’re going to learn how to collaborate with others
using Git and GitHub. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a shared repository</li>
<li>Make a first commit</li>
<li>Cover three routes for collaboration:
<ul>
<li>Independent Work</li>
<li>Code Review</li>
<li>Direct Edits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice resolving a merge conflict</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>To get the most out of this section of the training, you need a training buddy.
One of you will be the <em>lead researcher</em>, and the other will be the <em>colleague</em>.
The lead researcher will create the repository, and the colleague will contribute to it.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Researcher: Create a new repository on GitHub</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to GitHub, click on the “+” icon in the top-right corner, and select <code>New repository</code>.</li>
<li>Follow the same instructions as we did in the solo workflow to create a new
repository (add a README, choose a license, etc.).</li>
<li>Add your colleague as a collaborator by going to
<code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>Collaborators</code> &gt; <code>Add people</code>. Ask your colleague for their
GitHub username and add them to this repository.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colleague: Join the repository</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check your email for an invitation to collaborate on the repository.</li>
<li>Accept the invitation by clicking on the link in the email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Both: Clone the repository</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the main page of the repository clicking on the green <code>Code</code> button and
copying the URL. Then, in Bash/Terminal navigate to the location where you will
clone your repository and run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb40-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> clone {repository URL}</span></code></pre></div>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate into your repository by typing cd {repo-name}/</li>
<li>Type <code>git status</code>. The results shows you that no changes have been made yet:</li>

<ul>
<li>Create a new branch. Now that we know that our repository is cloned, up to
date, and on main, we can create a new branch to work on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Both:</strong> Create a new branch with the following command:</li>

<span id="cb43-2"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb43-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Typing <code>git branch</code> will show you that you are now on the new branch, though
only the first line was <em>necessary</em> to create this branch.</p>

<div id="collaborative-routes" class="section level2" number="8.4">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Collaborative Routes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collaborative-routes"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In general, there are three ways to work collaboratively on a project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Independent Work:</strong> You each work on separate files and merge your own changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Code Review:</strong> Submit pull requests for code reviews without direct edits.</li>
<li>
<strong>Direct Edits:</strong> Submit pull requests and make direct changes to each other’s code.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these different routes may seem ambiguous right now, you can think of pull
requests as akin to “Track Changes” in Microsoft Word or “Comments” in Google Docs.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative route #1 (Independent work)</strong> is like creating several separate
documents and storing them in a shared folder for you both to view.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative route #2 (Code review)</strong> is like having a shared document where
you can leave comments for each other - like when you leave comments on a
MS Word document for your colleague.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative route #3 (Direct edits)</strong> is like having a shared document where
you can make changes directly to your colleague’s work - think track changes.</p>
<p>We will cover each collaborative route below.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaborative-route-1-independent-work" class="section level2" number="8.5">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Collaborative Route #1: Independent work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collaborative-route-1-independent-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>You each work on separate files and merge your own changes. To start, the
repository will have two files, one that each of you made. In general, you could
maintain several files, each of your working on the specific files that make
sense but never editing each other’s files.</p>
<p>Let’s practice this workflow now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lead researcher:</strong> Save a code file that you brought to this workshop in the shared repository.</li>
<li>
<strong>Colleague:</strong> Save a code file that you brought to this workshop in the shared repository. If
your file has the same name as the lead researcher’s file, rename it now.</li>
<li>
<strong>Both:</strong> Add, commit, and push your respective files to GitHub:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb44-1"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb44-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add {file-name}</span>
<span id="cb44-2"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb44-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> commit <span class="at">-m</span> <span class="st">"Initial commit with {file-name}"</span></span>
<span id="cb44-3"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb44-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> push origin {new-branch-name}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If the output from the push command looks successful, you are now ready to create
a pull request following the same process we used in the solo workflow section.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Both:</strong> Navigate to GitHub.com to your repository’s URL. There should be a pale yellow
banner informing you about the changes you just pushed. Click the button
“Compare &amp; pull request”. Notice that the title is your commit message from the
previous step. Scroll down. Look at the files that have been added.</li>
<li>The code is all shown in green, indicating that every line of code is new.</li>
<li>Merge the changes from your branch into main</li>
<li>Click on the green “Create pull request” button. Github will check that it
is able to merge your branch with main without problems. Note the message “This
branch has no conflicts with the base branch”. This means you are good to go!</li>
<li>Click on the green “Merge pull request” button.<br>
</li>
<li>Click on the green “Confirm merge” button.</li>
<li>Click the “Delete branch” button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of your files have been merged into the main branch. Let’s take a look. Go
into the main <code>Code</code> page and take a look at the code on <code>main</code> (which should be
the only existing branch in your repository). You should see the files that
<em>both</em> of you created in the previous steps.</p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have now successfully completed the first collaborative route. You each
created a file, committed it, and merged it into the main branch. You worked on
different files and had no merge conflicts or interaction, but now have access
to each other’s work!</p></li>
<li><p>In this workflow, you could continue working independently on your file in
the shared repo and add other files as you go along.</p></li>
<li><p>❗ Take care: Now that you are working together, be sure
to use <code>git pull origin main</code> to grab any changes your colleague made to the
repository. You should be doing this already, but it is even more important
when you are working together so you can stay up to date on whatever changes
have been made to the repository.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="collaborative-route-2-code-review" class="section level2" number="8.6">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">8.6</span> Collaborative Route #2: Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collaborative-route-2-code-review"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In Collaborative Route #2, the lead researcher will make a new file, make
changes to that file and push these to GitHub. The colleague will then review
these changes by submitting comments on the pull request.</p>
<p>Let’s practice this workflow now:</p>
<p><strong>Lead researcher steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new branch with the following command:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb45-1"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb45-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout <span class="at">-b</span> {new-branch-name}</span>
<span id="cb45-2"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb45-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Make a change to the file you added in the previous step.
You can add in a comment or a new line of code - something small is good. Save
your file.</li>
<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to your branch on GitHub:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb46-1"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb46-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add {file-name}</span>
<span id="cb46-2"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb46-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> commit <span class="at">-m</span> <span class="st">"{your description of what you changed}"</span></span>
<span id="cb46-3"><a href="group-workflow.html#cb46-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> push origin {your-branch-name}</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Go to your GitHub repository page. You should see a notification about your
recent push. Click on “Compare &amp; pull request” next to your branch.</li>
<li>❗ <strong>NEW STEP ALERT</strong>: Fill in the details of the pull
request, explaining what you’ve added or changed and why.</li>
<li>❗ <strong>NEW STEP ALERT</strong>: Add your colleague as a
reviewer. We will not immediately merge this in this time!</li>
<li>Submit the pull request.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colleague steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the pull request is submitted, the colleague should receive an email telling them
that the lead researcher requested their review on PR #{X}.</li>
<li>Click <code>View it on GitHub</code> and it will bring you to GitHub and there will be a
yellow box at the top.</li>
<li>Click on <code>Add your review</code> in the yellow box. Then click <code>Review changes</code> in green in the right corner.</li>
<li>Leave comments on the pull request by clicking the plus signs next to chunks
of code. You can leave multiple comments. Your feedback can include suggestions,
questions, or general feedback about the code. Focus on clarity, efficiency, and
any potential errors you might notice.</li>
<li>When you’re finished commenting, click <code>Finish your review</code> in green in the top right.</li>
<li>Submit your comments. You can either:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Comment:</strong> This submits feedback without explicitly approving the pull request.</li>
<li>
<strong>Approve:</strong> This submits feedback and approves the pull request for merging into main.</li>
<li>
<strong>Request Changes:</strong> Submit feedback that the other person must address before they can merge into main.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a moment to talk briefly about each of these review options.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> This submits feedback without explicitly approving the pull request.
This will send the lead researcher an email with your comments on their code.
The lead researcher can click <code>View it on GitHub</code> to see your comments. They can
reply and/or merge the pull request into main at this point. This can be used
either as an FYI or to start a conversation about the code - e.g. maybe a
certain function is new to you so you want to ask about why they chose to use that.
You may want to use this if you have a workflow where you always want the person
who wrote the code to do the merging.</p>
<p><strong>Approve:</strong> This submits feedback and approves the PR for merging into main.
This will send the lead researcher an email with your comments that will also
indicate that the pull request is approved. This option can be used as an FYI,
e.g., telling them about an alternate function that they <em>could</em> use but do not
have to. Either person can merge the pull request into main. You can establish
norms around how these work with your colleagues - there is no right answer!</p>
<p><strong>Request Changes:</strong> Submit feedback that the other person needs to address
before they can merge into main. This will send the lead researcher an email
with your comments that will also indicate that the PR needs changes. This
option can be used if you see something that needs to change before the pull
request can be merged - e.g. a function that is not working as intended. The
lead researcher will need to address your comments before they can merge the
pull request into main. <em>Technically, the PR could be merged in without the
changes, but this is not good practice.</em></p>

<p>We have now practiced using Git to do a code review! You used Git to review/check/comment on our colleague’s work without emailing or copying/pasting code back and forth.

<p><strong>CR/LBW: DO WE WANT TO COVER THIS?</strong></p>
<p>In this scenario, after your colleague pushes their code, they will submit a pull request to you, and you will directly edit their code if needed. This may be useful if one person is stuck on a certain piece of the code, or if you are working very closely together on one script.</p>

<p>This route had you directly edited your colleague’s code. This can be very useful when one person knows how to do something that another person is stuck on, or when the code is a collaboration. This may not be very common in your work, but is a valuable tool if you are helping someone with code!</p>

<p>Merge conflicts can be a source of stress for many GitHub users. While they can
be scary, you are in good company when you have your first merge conflict –
everyone has a merge conflict eventually.</p>
<p>What is a merge conflict, you might ask, and how does it happen? Well, a merge
conflict can happen if you and a colleague edit the same location on the same
file. If colleague #1 merges their changes into main, then when colleague #2
goes to merge their changes into main, GitHub doesn’t know what to do. This can
occur if you both worked from the same version of main. Once colleague #1 merged
in their changes, colleague #2’s changes can’t be merged in without making
some decisions regarding whose changes should be kept.</p>
<p>If this seems a little convoluted, it is your lucky day. We will set the stage
for a merge conflict and practice resolving it with our buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a merge conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both researchers should be on <code>main</code> now. If you are not, please do
<code>git checkout main</code> and <code>git pull origin main</code> to make sure you are up to date.</li>
<li>Make and checkout a new branch: <code>git checkout -b {new-branch-name}</code>. Each of
you should call their branch something different from the other researcher.</li>
<li>Together, choose one file and one line location on the file that you will each
edit separately on your laptops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the lead researcher will first add, commit, and push their changes to
their branch. Then, they will create a pull request and merge their changes into
main. After this, the colleague will add, commit, and push their changes to
their branch. Then, they will create a pull request.</p>
<p>😨 Merge conflict!</p>
<p>You will not be able to merge into main.</p>
<p>We will walk you through how to resolve the merge conflict.</p>
<p>The colleague with the conflict will see the following. Colleague, follow these steps!
Lead researcher, watch your colleague’s screen to see how this looks:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="figures/merge-conflict-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Click on <code>View Pull Request</code> to begin resolving the merge conflict. When you click on <code>View Pull Request</code>, you will see the following:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="figures/merge-conflict-2.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Click on <code>Resolve conflicts</code> to begin resolving the merge conflict. When you click on <code>Resolve conflicts</code>, you will see the following:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="figures/Example-merge-conflict-github.png" width="75%"></div>
<p>Together, look at the code in the file. Decide which edits you will keep. For
this exercise, it is arbitrary which edits you keep. However, in practice you
will make this decision in an informed way.</p>
<p>When you choose what to keep, delete the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>===</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> lines, as
well as the lines from the person whose code you are not keeping. When you are
finished, click <code>Mark as resolved</code> in the top right corner. Now that you have
clicked <code>Mark as resolved</code>, you will see a green check mark next to the file
name, and it will say <code>Resolved</code> in the top right corner. There will also be a
green button in the top right corner that says <code>Commit merge</code>. Click on this
button. This brings you back to the page you are familiar with, where you can
merge into main. Click <code>Merge pull request</code> and then <code>Confirm merge</code>. You can
delete the branch as you usually do.</p>
<p>You have just resolved your first merge conflict!</p>
