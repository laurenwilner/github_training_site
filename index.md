# Git and GitHub for Public Health

This is the website for the training **"Git and GitHub for Public Health"**, 
first offered in 2024. 

## Overview 

Keeping track of changes to your statistical code is key to reducing errors and boosting teamwork in your projects. However, many public health professionals, including epidemiologists, haven't been trained on how to manage these changes, which might leave you wondering about the integration with institutional review board (IRB) protocols and privacy rules. On this website, we dive into the basics of Git and GitHub. We're here to show you how these tools can help you confidently and ethically manage your code changes, making your work and research smoother and more secure.
