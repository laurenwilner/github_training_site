# What to track on Git and Github?

## Approach 1 : Track statistical code only

Some people use Git and Github to track changes to their statistical code only. 
Here, they are only tracking their code files in R (.R or .Rmd), or 
SAS (.SAS), or the corresponding files for whichever language they use. 

They add all other types of files to the .gitignore file so that Git
won't track them or accidentally push them to GitHub. Under this approach, 
untracked files include: data files, word documents, PDFs, image files, etc -- 
anything else you are storing looking in the folder tracked by git that you do
not want pushed to GitHub.

This approach most closely corresponds to how GitHub is used by software 
developers/other code writers, and is used by researchers and research 
teams depending on their objectives.

## Approach 2: Track statistical code, some data files, images, and other documents

Some people use Git and Github to track a variety of files including their code, 
*some* of their data files, as well as images and other documents. This approach
is often used by advocates of reproducible research, and to give outsiders a 
fuller picture of an entire research project. 

Sometimes, you can post your data, if it is unrestricted and not too large. In 
this case, you can set up your GitHub so that all of your data visualizations 
as well as a completed report can be reproduced by someone who is not affliated
with your project. 

In many research or public health settings, you are not able to share the data. 
In this case, you can still share other aspects of your project with the wider 
community.

### Data files do's and dont's

```{r, echo=F}
library(emo)
```

`r emo::ji("x")` **Don't track restricted data!**

Restricted data cannot be posted on GitHub. A best practice is to store it 
securely outside of your tracked folder to ensure there is no chance of it being
posted. 

`r emo::ji("x")` **Dont' track large datasets!** 

Git will warn you if your file exceeds 50 MB and 
block you from tracking files 100 MB or larger. To ensure these files aren't tracked, you can store them elsewhere (outside of
the tracked Git folder), or store them in the tracked folder while also listing them or their file type to your .gitignore file. 

`r emo::ji("thinking")` **Consider tracking intermediate data products**

Generally, it also doesn't often make sense to track a large "raw" data file -- it is too big and not useful to track any changes to this file. It may be helpful to track "intermediate data products", if these files are not restricted. Intermediate data products might include aggregated datasets that are either reported directly or used in analysis. For example, you may have access to a restricted dataset, but the data may become non-restricted if you aggregate at the level of the census tract. The benefit of tracking this smaller dataset is that if the raw data is updated, you can easily see how those updates affect these intermediate data products if you track them. In this case you need to ensure you are not reporting any private/restricted data (eg no cell counts below 10 is a restricted often imposed on aggregated tables, or not reporting any identifying features such as protected health information or anything else that would allow anyone with access to identify 
individuals.

`r emo::ji("check")` **Do track plain text data files (e.g., csv and txt files) **

These are best for tracking because they render nicely on GitHub, so you can
easily view the differences to these files when you submit a pull request. You 
could also track things like Excel files but you can't easily view them on 
GitHub, so some of the benefits of using GitHub do not apply to these files.
   
### Images dos and dont's

You can also track image files (e.g., png, jpeg), such as plots/other figures 
you create for a report. The benefit of  tracking figures are the use of the 
[image comparison tools](https://github.blog/2011-03-21-behold-image-view-modes/)
in GitHub to see an image pre/post a change in the 
analysis. This can be super helpful when you have modified something in the 
analysis after having already written up some results. If you track the image, 
you can easily see how it changed (it being the point estimates and confidence
intervals, of the slope of the regression line, or the shading of a colored map).
This has the direct pay-off of making it much easier to revise the written 
result.

`r emo::ji("x")` **Dont' track very large image files**

One thing to be careful about is not uploading very large images like the 
ones that are generated by some GIS analyses (large maps). If you aren't sure if
you should track your image file, take a look at the file size. (I had a look at
all of my repositories for epidemiologic analyses -- most images were < 1000 kb.
Some were between 1 MB and 4 MB -- these were some maps and some images saved at
higher resolutions.)

### Documents

You can also track reports and manuscripts using GitHub. If these reports are 
written in a plain text language (e.g., R markdown, LaTeX) then they will render
nicely on GitHub and, and permit you to see the "diffs" made to the document 
during a pull request. Tracking pdfs is permissible but you can't easily see the
"diffs" when they are updated. However, pdfs are easily viewable on GitHub. 
Tracking docx files is also permissible, but you can't easily see the "diffs" 
and they are not easily viewable on GitHub (since they require MS Word to render
them). 

`r emo::ji("check")` **Do track plain text reports like R markdown files**  
`r emo::ji("thinking")` **Consider tracking PDFs (easily viewable on GitHub)**  
`r emo::ji("x")` **Don't track Word documents (cannot view)**


## Things you definitely do not want to track

`r emo::ji("x")` **Anything that is private or restricted or that you would never want to 
inadvertently share.**

* This includes passwords, or API keys that you might use to extract data. 
* For example, I have an API key to access Census data. I do not include this
API key in my GitHub repository. There are methods for writing the code to still
access the key on my personal computer without writing it out explicitly in the 
code.
