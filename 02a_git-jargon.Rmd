# Git Jargon

[Alice Bartlett](https://github.com/alicebartlett) is a Principal Engineer at 
the Financial Times. She made an excellent set of slides introducing Git and 
GitHub and the associated jargon:

* repository, or "repo"
* commit
* hash
* checkout
* branch
* merge
* remote
* clone
* push 
* pull

In the live workshop, we will go through Alison's slides together. If you are
