# Git Jargon

Before diving into using Git and GitHub, we need to become immersed in its 
jargon. Fortunately, [Alice Bartlett](https://github.com/alicebartlett), a 
Principal Engineer at the Financial Times, made an excellent set of slides on 
Git and GitHub and the associated jargon. She covers:

* repository, or "repo"
* commit
* hash
* checkout
* branch
* merge
* remote
* clone
* push 
* pull

In the live workshop, we will go through Alice's slides together. If you are 
going through this training asynchronously, you can flip through Alice's slides
